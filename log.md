# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 03, 2021
**Today's Progress**: 
* Add a github action that sends a discord ping, to remind me to work on it + keep the discord thread opened. 
* Finish writing the front-end specs for the site sections, user POV
* Gathered the team in the discord server of my uni. programming club ([@CPU-Paris](https://github.com/CPU-Paris))

**Thoughts:** : I really like how I programmed that discord reminder. It's a github workflow inside this repo that sends a post request to a custom webhook payload stored in a safe place. It's not the best way, but it's surely original !

### Day 0: November 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I'm starting the 100 days of code challenge for [Kagescan-cms](https://github.com/kagescan/kagescan-cms).  
I created a Notion workspace and started writing some specifications for the scan part of the CMS. This is a productivity tool I discovered today.

**Thoughts:** Every programmers knows this is always good to write down a complete specification documentation if you're going to work with a team on a project you owns.  So I need to finish it before starting to code.
