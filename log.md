**Today's Progress**: 

* Made some progress with Notion, and [a question I had with routing](https://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-79952.html)
* Set up my coding workspace and edited the docs about cloning the repo with symlinks : [0d40643](https://github.com/Kagescan/kagescan-cms/commit/0d406434804b2b105f6007d76c09dac05aae9fa3)
* Found a way to store my ordered dataset in MYSQL in discord [private discord thread link](https://discord.com/channels/306353736249245697/453984845123551235/905931581682753596)


**Thoughts:** : I had a dilemna about how to store ordered data in PHP : Using Json or SQL ? I finally managed to solve this using a linked list pattern and backend processing (instead of DBMS sorting).

### Day 1: November 03, 2021
**Today's Progress**: 
* Add a github action that sends a discord ping, to remind me to work on it + keep the discord thread opened. 
* Finish writing the front-end specs for the site sections, user POV
* Gathered the team in the discord server of my uni. programming club ([@CPU-Paris](https://github.com/CPU-Paris))

**Thoughts:** : I really like how I programmed that discord reminder. It's a github workflow inside this repo that sends a post request to a custom webhook payload stored in a safe place. It's not the best way, but it's surely original !

### Day 0: November 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I'm starting the 100 days of code challenge for [Kagescan-cms](https://github.com/kagescan/kagescan-cms).  
I created a Notion workspace and started writing some specifications for the scan part of the CMS. This is a productivity tool I discovered today.

**Thoughts:** Every programmers knows this is always good to write down a complete specification documentation if you're going to work with a team on a project you owns.  So I need to finish it before starting to code.
