# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I'm starting the 100 days of code challenge for [Kagescan-cms](https://github.com/kagescan/kagescan-cms).  
I created a Notion workspace and started writing some specifications for the scan part of the CMS. This is a productivity tool I discovered today.

**Thoughts:** Every programmers knows this is always good to write down a complete specification documentation if you're going to work with a team on a project you owns.  So I need to finish it before starting to code.
