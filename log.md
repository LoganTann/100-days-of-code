# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 9 : Thursday 11, november 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Fixed for real the bug from yesterday without quickfixes. It was due to configuration problem that involved cache and databases prefixes. [e3c124f](https://github.com/Kagescan/kagescan-cms/commit/e3c124f)
- Implemented three unit tests and improved the existing one. [1ddc36c](https://github.com/Kagescan/kagescan-cms/commit/1ddc36c)
- Made some minor edits [f79c9d2](https://github.com/Kagescan/kagescan-cms/commit/f79c9d2)


**Thoughts:** It is a public holiday today (1918 armistice). I took the opportunity to take a *vacation* during this *afternoon*, which is why there is not as much code as expected.

### Day 3: Friday November 05, 2021

<table><tr><td>
  
**Today's Progress**: 
* Created a [Kanban board in Notion](https://www.notion.so/kagescan/bdd40eae13534f03aac7535138abdf4f?v=b8e3c9c43a9e4a89b7a82fdffddd9671) and made some progress to organize the team
* Implemented the sql creation table script for the manga section : [6eb9576 and a68930a](https://github.com/Kagescan/kagescan-cms/compare/0d40643..a68930a)
  
**Thoughts:** Kanban boards are very nice to set-up tasks and deadlines.  
  Even though Notion isn't the best app for doing this sort of thing, the integration with pages is pretty cool, we can link a task to a doc spec for example.

### Day 2: Thursday November 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 

* Made some progress with Notion, and [a question I had with routing](https://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-79952.html)
* Set up my coding workspace and edited the docs about cloning the repo with symlinks : [0d40643](https://github.com/Kagescan/kagescan-cms/commit/0d406434804b2b105f6007d76c09dac05aae9fa3)
* Found a way to store my ordered dataset in MYSQL in discord [private discord thread link](https://discord.com/channels/306353736249245697/453984845123551235/905931581682753596)


**Thoughts:** : I had a dilemna about how to store ordered data in PHP : Using Json or SQL ? I finally managed to solve this using a linked list pattern and backend processing (instead of DBMS sorting).

### Day 1: Wednesday November 03, 2021
**Today's Progress**: 
* Add a github action that sends a discord ping, to remind me to work on it + keep the discord thread opened. 
* Finish writing the front-end specs for the site sections, user POV
* Gathered the team in the discord server of my uni. programming club ([@CPU-Paris](https://github.com/CPU-Paris))

**Thoughts:** : I really like how I programmed that discord reminder. It's a github workflow inside this repo that sends a post request to a custom webhook payload stored in a safe place. It's not the best way, but it's surely original !

### Day 0: Tuesday November 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I'm starting the 100 days of code challenge for [Kagescan-cms](https://github.com/kagescan/kagescan-cms).  
I created a Notion workspace and started writing some specifications for the scan part of the CMS. This is a productivity tool I discovered today.

**Thoughts:** Every programmers knows this is always good to write down a complete specification documentation if you're going to work with a team on a project you owns.  So I need to finish it before starting to code.
